## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

I added JS functionalities to an HTML and CSS template for the first time.

I learned mostly about: regular expressions, event listeners, adding CSS classes...

### Continued development

I'd like to code less by creating more dynamic functions
